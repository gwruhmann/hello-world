General Thoughts and Notes

Hello there!

My name is Garrett.  I stumbled into the /r/learnprogramming sub-reddit one day and fell down an obsessive hole of learning as much as I can, as well as I can.  Right now I'm working on the basics of front-end web development--HTML, CSS, JavaScript--but I plan on expanding my horizons over time as I look to make a career change in the future.  I hope you'll join me in my learning adventures!
